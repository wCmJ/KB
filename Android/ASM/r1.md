ASM: (Android Security Modules), A Java bytecode engineering library
    - java bytecode manipulation and analysis framework
    - modify existing classes or to dynamically generate classes, directly in binary form
    - provides some common bytecode transformations and analysis algorithms from which custom complex transformations and code analysis tools can be built.
    - focus on performance
    used
        - openjdk
        - Groovy compiler and Kotlin compiler
        - Cobertura and Jacoco
        - CGLIB
        - Gradle, to generate some classes at runtime

    - program analysis, generate, transform
    - java source code or compiled java classes

    - ASM library is strictly limited to reading, writing, transforming and analyzing classes, the class loading process is out of scope

        - analysis: 








    - provide a programmable interface for defining new reference monitors for Android
